# Language Model Implementation in Pytorch

This repository is a collection of various language model implementations, ranging from simple RNN-based models to advanced transformer architectures. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts interested in exploring different aspects of natural language processing and understanding through practical code examples and detailed documentation.

## Introduction

Language models are at the heart of many NLP tasks, including text generation, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. This repository aims to cover a wide spectrum of models, providing insights into their architecture, functionality, and application.

## Models Included

This repository includes implementations for the following language models:
- RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- Transformer
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
- [Add more models as necessary]

Each model directory contains the following:
- Source code
- Pre-trained models (if available)
- Documentation on how to train, validate, and deploy the models
- Examples and tutorials

## Getting Started

To get started with these implementations, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip
- [Other necessary software or libraries]

### Installation
